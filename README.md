# qty4 CPU 
A open-source tiny 4 bit CPU project! The goal of this project is to build a tiny 4-bit programmable computer that can fit onto one PCB. We also would like to have many LEDs to show the cpu's state as it prossess commands, just like the BenEater 8-bit computer.

## Instruction Set
Since the computer is only using 4-bits to address the memory, we are limited to 16 possible operations. These operations are listed below.

```
--- ALU

# add
# sub
# inc
# dec

--- JUMP

# jmp
# jc
# jz
# jnc
# jnz

--- REGISTERS

# lda
# ldb
# sta
# stb

--- MISC

# nop
# hlt

```

## General Parts
```


```

## Inspiration for the Project 
This cpu is based on the BenEater 8-bit computer (https://eater.net/8bit/schematics)
