Modules chips and parts:

Clock:
	555 timer x 3

RAM:
	arduino nano
	shift register (?)
	4 bit register chip
	2 4 bit x 4 bit ram chips
	
Instruction register:
	4 bit register chip

control logic:
	4 bit counter (step counter)
	eeproms (1 or 2?)
	demultiplexers?
	
program counter:
	4 bit counter with input and output

alu:
	4 bit register x 4 (a + b registers & sum holder & flags register)
	4 bit adder chip
	xor (?) chip for 2's complemtnt subtraction
	nor + and for checking if zero
	
output:
	7 segment display
	4 bit register
	hex 7 segment display driver chip

notes:
	will need leds, caps, resistors, and other stuff
	
	currently not accounting for extra bus driver chips that 
	would be needed to have register contents on leds at all times
